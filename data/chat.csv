","I enjoy the winter , but it gets really cold sometimes .
"
"I know what you mean , but I 'd rather it be cold than hot .
","That 's exactly how I feel .
"
"I wish it was a nicer day today .
","That is true . I hope it does n't rain .
"
"It would n't rain in the middle of the summer .
","It would n't seem right if it started raining right now .
"
"It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather .
","Any rain right now would be pointless .
"
"That 's right , it really would be .
","I want it to cool down some .
"
"I know what you mean , I ca n't wait until it 's winter .
","Winter is great . I wish it did n't get so cold sometimes though .
"
"I would rather deal with the winter than the summer .
","I feel the same way .
"
"It 's an ugly day today .
","I know . I think it will be raining .
"
"It 's the middle of summer , and it should n't be raining today .
","That would be weird if it rains .
"
"Yeah , especially since it 's ninety degrees outside .
","I know . It would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside .
"
"Yes , it would be very bad if it rained .
","I really wish it was n't so hot and humid every day .
"
"Me too . I ca n't wait until winter .
","I like winter too , but sometimes it gets too cold .
"
"I 'd rather it be cold than hot .
","Me too .
"
"It 's such a nice day .
","Yes , it is .
"
"It looks like it may rain soon .

"
"Why do you like it rains ?

"
"Me too . It always smells so fresh after it rains .

"
"I really hope it rains today .
","Yeah , me too .

","Will it be good beach weather ?
"
"I think it will be .
","It would n't be good if it got cold this weekend .
"
"I want this trip to be perfect , I hope it stays warm .
","This California weather is so uncertain , it 's impossible to know what 'll happen .
"
"I know . Every day the weather seems different .
","I would love it if it was n't always so unpredictable .
"
"That would make it easier for us to make plans .
","I know . Things are easier when you know what the weather 's going to be like .
